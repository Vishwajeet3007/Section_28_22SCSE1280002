# 24.Explain the concept of bit manipulation and its advantages in algorithm design. 

"""
Bit manipulation refers to the process of directly manipulating bits 
(the smallest unit of data) at the binary level using bitwise operators.
 In computer systems, data is ultimately represented in binary (1s and 0s),
   and bit manipulation operates directly on these bits.
