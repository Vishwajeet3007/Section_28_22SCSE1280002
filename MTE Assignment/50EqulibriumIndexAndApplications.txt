Qn: Explain the concept of equilibrium index and its applications in array problems. 
->An equilibrium index is like the perfect balancing point in an array.
->It’s where the left and right sides weigh exactly the same!

==>An equilibrium index in an array is an index i such that:
->The sum of elements on the left of i is equal to the sum of elements on the right of i.

✅Important points:
The element at index i itself is not included in either left or right sum.
There can be zero, one, or multiple equilibrium indices.

Applications of Equilibrium Index in Array Problems:

Application Area	                     Why Equilibrium Index Matters
Load Balancing	                  Distribute tasks or weights equally across servers/systems.
Financial Calculations	          Find balance points in profit/loss series.
Game Development	              Balance health points, resource allocations.
Partitioning Problems	          Split an array into two parts with equal sum for optimization tasks.
Data Analysis	                  Find balanced cut-points in datasets.
