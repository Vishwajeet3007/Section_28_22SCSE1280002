Qn: Explain the concept of priority queues and their applications in algorithm design. 
->A Priority Queue ensures important things are done first according to their priority, 
not their arrival time.
-> priority queue is a special type of queue where each element has a priority, and the element with the highest (or lowest) priority is served first â€” not necessarily the one that arrived first.
i. In a normal queue: First-In-First-Out (FIFO).
ii. In a priority queue: Highest priority goes first (not arrival order).

Example:In an emergency room, patients are treated based on the seriousness of their
 condition, not on the order they arrived.

==>Applications of Priority Queues in Algorithm Design:
1.Dijkstra's Algorithm(Finding the shortest path in a graph)
2.Huffman Encoding(Data compression)
3.CPU Scheduling(Multitasking operating systems)
