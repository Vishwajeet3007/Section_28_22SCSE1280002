Qn: Explain the concept of histogram problems and their applications in algorithm design
->A histogram problem teaches how to maximize area or trap water between bars,
and it appears naturally in optimization, design, and simulation tasks.
->Understanding it makes you great at using stacks and two pointers!
->The histogram problem usually refers to a bar graph where each barâ€™s height represents 
a value

==>Applications in Algorithm Design:
Application Area	                                 Why Histogram Problems Matter
Stack-based algorithms        	          Teaches how to use stacks to solve range problems efficiently.
Graphical layouts / GUI design	          Optimal allocation of space in layouts and dashboards.
Dynamic Programming Optimization	      Some 2D problems (like maximal rectangle in a matrix) reduce to histograms.
Memory Management	                      Allocating memory blocks efficiently (similar to maximizing areas).
Rainwater trapping simulation	          Useful in physical simulations of water flow or volume estimations.
