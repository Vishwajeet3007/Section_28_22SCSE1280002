Qn:Explain the concept of dynamic programming and its use in solving the maximum 
subarray problem.

Dynamic Programming is a method used in programming to solve complex problems by 
breaking them down into smaller subproblems, solving each subproblem only once, 
and storing their results (usually in a table or variables) so they don't need to be
 recomputed.

✅ It is mainly used when:
The problem has overlapping subproblems (same subproblems get solved multiple times).
The problem has an optimal substructure (the optimal solution can be built from optimal 
solutions of its subproblems).

-->How Dynamic Programming Helps in the Maximum Subarray Problem

The Maximum Subarray Problem asks:
->Find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum.

->Now, notice:
->To find the maximum subarray ending at index i, we can use the solution of the
maximum subarray ending at i-1.
-->So each subproblem depends on the previous one — perfect for dynamic programming!
