 # Explain the concept of linked lists and their applications in algorithm design.

"""
A linked list is a linear data structure consisting of a sequence of elements 
where each element (called a node) contains two parts:

Data: Stores the actual value or information.
Next: A reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.

The linked list does not store elements in contiguous memory locations,
 unlike arrays. Instead, each node points to the next node, forming a chain.

Types of Linked Lists:

1.Singly Linked List:
    Each node has a reference to the next node.
    The last node’s reference points to None (or null in some languages).

2.Doubly Linked List:
    Each node has two references: one to the next node and one to the previous node.
    This allows traversal in both directions.

3. Circular Linked List:
    The last node’s reference points back to the first node, forming a circular structure.

Operations on Linked Lists:
    Common operations on linked lists include:

    1.Insertion: Adding a new node at the beginning, end, or at a specific position.

    2.Deletion: Removing a node from the beginning, end, or a specific position.

    3.Traversal: Accessing each node starting from the head (first node).

    4.Search: Finding a node with a specific value.

    5.Reversal: Reversing the order of nodes in the list.

Applications of Linked Lists in Algorithm Design:
1. Dynamic Memory Allocation
2. Implementation of Data Structures
3. Efficient Insertions and Deletions
4.Circular Linked Lists for Round Robin Scheduling
