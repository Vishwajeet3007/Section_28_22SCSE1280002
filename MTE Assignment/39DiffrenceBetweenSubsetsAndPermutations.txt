Qn : Generate all permutations of a given array. Write its algorithm, program. Find its
time and space complexities. Explain with suitable example. 

1. Permutations
    Definition: A permutation is an arrangement of all or some elements of a set in a 
    specific order.

    ->Order matters
    ->No repetition of elements
    ->Length = original or shorter
2. Subsets
Definition:A subset is any combination of elements from a set, regardless of order.
    ->Order doesn't matter
    ->Each element is either included or not included
    ->The total number of subsets of a set with n elements is 2^n
